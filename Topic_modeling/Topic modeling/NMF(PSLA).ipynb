Pruning here effectively refers to increasing sparsity in the network and given a neural network layer, pruning can be performed in 2 ways:1. Weight pruning: set individual weights in the weight matrix to zero. This corresponds to deleting connections between the neurons of consecutive layers. Here, to achieve sparsity of k% we rank the individual weights in weight matrix W according to their magnitude (absolute value) |w(i,j)|, and then set to zero the smallest k%.2. Unit/Neuron pruning: set entire columns in the weight matrix to zero, in effect deleting the corresponding output neuron. Here to achieve sparsity of k% we rank the columns of a weight matrix according to their L2-norm & delete the neurons with the smallest k% norms.Naturally, as we increase the sparsity and delete more of the network, the task performance will progressively degrade.I have plotted the accuracy vs sparsity plots for both weight pruning and neuron pruning.', \"Industrial production of electric and gas utilities from the years 1985-2018 was taken as an input factor.

Search engines involve two primary tasks: retrieval of documents and ranking them in order of relevance. While improving that ranking is an extremely important part of improving the search experience, actually understanding that query helps give the searcher exactly what theyre looking for.GO-FOOD uses the ElasticSearch stack with restaurant and dish indexes to search for what the user types. However, this results in only exact & partial text matches and at most, fuzzy matches.In order to create a holistic search experience that not only personalised search results, but also retrieved restaurants and dishes that were more relevant to what the user was looking for, we are working on developing a Query Semantics Engine. It uses the concepts of Query Understanding to make the semantic neighbours of the query itself become the focus of the search process and increase the recall of search results.This is being done by using search and booking history in conjunction with the internal food database to build embeddings that can be used to represent query semantics.

We usually have 22 to 23 variants of our OS and it takes almost one week to manually configure all these and run all those test cases. But this tool can do all these stuffs automatically and that too within 2 days. It also generates beautiful looking excel report sheets containing how many files compiled, how many test cases were run, how many of these are failures and some other information. This not only reduced manual parsing of log files but also produces excel sheet which can be considered as a result for all of our nightly builds and can be produced as an DOD for our Product Owners and Agile Masters as the excel reports will speak everything about the OS.

The project was done in two parts. First, the most frequented pickup-points, or gates, for each PoI were found by clustering the location coordinates, and subsequently building a Language model for each cluster to determine the name for the gate.We used historical booking data on where exactly customers were being picked up from and filtered them on the basis of polygons sourced from OSM to find bookings created inside the POI. The KMeans algorithm was used to cluster historical pickup points for a POI, and the optimal value of k for each POI was calculated using the elbow method and the stupid backoff method.Then, for each gate, we used the pickup notes that customers wrote to drivers within the app and built an n-gram based Language model. The phrase generated by the model using the vocabulary from the notes that had maximum probability was then assigned as the gate name.', 'The project resulted in a huge speedup (more than 300 times faster) in the training time required to learn word embeddings/vectors using FastText (a popular unsupervised word vectors learning algorithm by Facebook AI Research).
